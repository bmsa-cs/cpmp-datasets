# Data Analysis
#Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly anxious state that can develop after exposure to psychological trauma. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) collected data on 852 veterans who screened positive for PTSD. The table above shows some of their results; in particular, whether a veteran received minimally adequate treatment (MAT) or not. Consider these a random sample of all veterans diagnosed with PTSD.
