# Data Analysis
#In a science project, a student wanted to determine whether 6th-graders did better when they took a math test in silence or when Mozart was being played. Twenty-six students were randomly divided into the two treatment groups. Part of the student's results are in the table below.Math Test PerformanceiC iC Mozart (% correct)	Silence (% correct)65	4480	7072	6868	5838	5858	4745	5442	4458	6181	6140	941	5227	30
