## Officer Trainees
File: OfficerTrainees.tsv
Description: Data Analysis
Injuries of the leg, knee, and foot are common in people who do a lot of running, such as military recruits undergoing basic training. Researchers wanted to know whether foot orthotics, shoe inserts custom-molded to the personï¿½s foot and fitted by a specialist, might help prevent such injuries. Four hundred military officer trainees were identified as medium or high risk for leg, knee, or foot injury on the basis of gait assessment measured on a test track. They were randomly split into two groups. One  group got custom orthotics and the other did not. After seven weeks of basic training, 21 of the 200 who had received custom orthotics had a leg, knee, or foot injury that required that he or she stop physical training for two or more days. Sixty-one of the 200 who did not get orthotics had such injuries. (Source: Andrew Franklyn-Miller, et al.

## Instructor Attributes

Description: Data Analysis
A group of 49 volunteer college students were randomly assigned to two treatments.

Then all students watched the same 20-minute lecture given by the same instructor. Following the lecture, subjects rated the lecturer. The students' summary ratings are given here. Higher ratings are better. (Source: www.ruf.rice.edu/%7Elane/case_studies/instructor_reputation/index.html; Their source: Towler, Annette., and Dipboye, R. L. (1998).

## Optimal Foraging
File: OptimalForaging.tsv
Description: Data Analysis
Sea gulls and crows feed on various types of mollusks by lifting them into the air and dropping them onto a rock to break open their shells. Biologists have observed that northwestern crows consistently drop a type of mollusk called a whelk from approximately the same height. The crows appear to be selective; they pick up only large-sized whelks. They are also persistent. For instance, one crow was observed to drop a single whelk 20 times. Scientists have suggested that this behavior is an example of decision-making in optimal foraging. These data show the average number of drops needed to break a whelk for various heights (in meters). (Sources: Zach, Reto. "Selection and Dropping of Whelks by Northwestern Crows." Behavior 67 (1978): 134-47; Zach, Reto. "Shell Dropping: Decision-Making and Optimal Foraging in Northwestern Crows." Behavior 68 (1979): 106-17.)
